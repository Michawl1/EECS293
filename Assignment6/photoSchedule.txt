This is the pseudo code outline of the Photo Schedule class

photo schedule will have 1 variable to keep track of:
a priority queue containing Photo Times
(a queue is a First In First Out type list)
(a priority queue is a list of items that is ordered in accordance with some 
value routine, an object with a higher value gets placed before an object with
a lower value.  These value functions are described within the object that a 
queue contains.  Any new object that is added into the priority queue will 
automatically be sorted into it's correct position in accordance with said 
value function)

There will be a constructor that will accept a new priority queue and copy it
to this Photo Schedule's priority queue

There will be a constructor that does not accept anything and will make
an empty priority queue

Photo Schedule will have a getter for it's priority queue


This routine will add a new Photo Time into the priority queue
	Add the new Photo Time into this's priority queue


This routine will remove a Photo Time from the priority queue
	remove the given Photo Time from this's priority queue


This routine will generate the schedule of Photo Times to go to
	use the greedy first search algorithm to get a list of Photo Times to 
	go to

	return the generated list of Photo Times
