This is the pseudo code outline of the Photo Schedule class

photo schedule will have 3 variables to keep track of, all of which will be protected data:
a priority queue containing Photo Times
	(a queue is a First In First Out type list)
	(a priority queue is a list of items that is ordered in accordance with some 
	value routine, an object with a higher value gets placed before an object with
	a lower value.  These value functions are described within the object that a 
	queue contains.  Any new object that is added into the priority queue will 
	automatically be sorted into it's correct position in accordance with said 
	value function)
a value to store the Start Time for the best lighting
a value to store the End Time for the best lighting

There will be a constructor that will be protected
it will accept a priority queue, starting time, and ending time
	ensure that the starting time occurs before the ending time
	(if they don't throw an error)
	set this's priority queue to a copy of the provided priority queue
	set this's start time to the given start time
	set this's start time to the given start time

There will be a builder that will accept a new priority queue and copy it
to this Photo Schedule's priority queue
it will also accept a value for Starting Time
it will also accept a value for Ending Time
	return a new Photo Schedule object with the priority queue, 
	starting time, and ending time

There will be a builder that does not accept anything and will make
an empty priority queue
it will also accept a value for Starting Time
it will also accept a value for Ending Time
	return a new Photo Schedule object with a new, empty priority queue,
	starting time, and ending time

Photo Schedule will have a getter for it's priority queue

*Add Photo Time*
This routine will add a new Photo Time into the priority queue
	if the new Photo time has a start time and end time within the
	Photo Schedule's start and end time for lighting
		Add the new Photo Time into this's priority queue
		return true

	if not
		return false

*Remove Photo Time*
This routine will remove a Photo Time from the priority queue
	remove the given Photo Time from this's priority queue

*Generate Schedule*
This routine will generate the schedule of Photo Times to go to
	use the greedy first search algorithm to get a list of Photo Times to 
	go to

	return the generated list of Photo Times
