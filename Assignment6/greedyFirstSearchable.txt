*Is Before*
-Input: an object to compare to this to see if it is before
-Output: a true false statement
This routine will determine wheter or not the object occurs before this object
	return true if the object occurs before this object, false otherwise

*Is After*
-Input: an object to compare to this to see if it is after
-Output: a true false statement
This routine will determine whether or not the object occurs after this object
	return true if the object occurs after this object, false otherwise

*Get Value*
-Output: a digit value of the object
This routine will get the value of a given object as some digit
	return the some enumeratable value of the object
