The Greedy First Search routine will require a priority queue (a queue sorted by some method) provided to it
	there will be a list of best options called best options

	first we will add the first item of the priority queue to the best options list
	this is the greedy assumption we make for this algorithm

	while there are still items in the priority queue
		get the new item off of the queue
		(this shall remove an item from the queue)
		for readablitiy this item will be called the focus item

		if the focus item is after the most recent addition to the queue's end time
			add the focus item to the list
		else 
			add the focus item to an unused list

	call the insert unused list routine
				
	return the best options list


This Greedy Fist Search routine will require a list of best options and a list of unused options
	while there are items in the used list
		remove the an unused item from the list and store it (we'll call it the focus item)

		if the focus item
