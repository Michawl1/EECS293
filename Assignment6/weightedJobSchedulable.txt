This is the pseudo code outline of the Greedy First Searchable interface

*Get Value*
-Output: a digit value of the object
This routine will get the value of a given object as some digit
	return the some enumeratable value of the object

*Get Linked Object*
-Output: the linked item if its avaiable, null if there is none
This routine is meant to back through the linked list

*Does Overlap*
-Input: an object to compare to this to see if it is after
-Output: a true false statement
This routine will determine whether or not the object's time frame overlaps 
this object's time frame
	return true if the objects time overlap, false otherwise

*Link Object*
-Input: a different Weighted Job Shedulable item
This routine acts as a way to create a linked list within the implementation
so that it can be traced back through later
