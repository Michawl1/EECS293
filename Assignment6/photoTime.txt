This is the pseudo code outline of the Photo Time class

Photo Time will implement the interface Greedy First Searchable

photo time will have 4 variables to keep track of:
a name for the landmark
the start time for the photo shoot
the end time for the photo shoot
a representation of the priority (some digit)

The constructor will set the values for the 4 variables listed above

The photo time will have getters for the start time, end time, and priority


This routine will get the time elapsed during the photo shoot
	return the time it takes from the start of the photo shoot to the end of 
	the photo shoot


*This is an implementation of the first Greedy First Searchable routine
This routine will returns a true false statement to whether a given Photo Time
occurs after this Photo Time's end time
	return true if the new Photo Time's end time is after the beginning time of 
	this Photo Time
	return false if the new Photo Time's end time is before the beginning time of
	this Photo Time


*This is an implementation of the second Greedy First Searchable routine
This routine gets the value of the Photo Time
	return the priority of the photo shoot


This routine will be used to provide a way to sort the Photo Times
	if this Photo Time's end time is before the new Photo Time's end time
		we want to return 1
	if this Photo Time's end time is after the new Photo Time's end time
		we want to return -1
	if the end times are equal we want to defer to the priority
		The higher priority is more valuable than the lower priority


This routine will be used to make a sentence describing the Photo Time
	return the name of the landmark
