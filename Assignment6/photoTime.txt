This is the pseudo code outline of the Photo Time class

Photo Time will implement the interface Greedy First Searchable

photo time will have 4 variables to keep track of:
a name for the landmark
the start time for the photo shoot
the end time for the photo shoot
a representation of the priority (some digit)


*There will be a constructor that will be protected
-Input: a value for the landmark
        a value for the start time
        a value for the end time
        a value for the priority
This routine will make a new object
	ensure that the start time occurs before the ending time
	(if they don't throw an error)
	set this's landmark to the given landmark
	set this's start time to the given start time
	set this's end time to the given end time
	set this's priority to the given priority

*There will be a builder
-Input: a value for the landmark
        a value for the start time
        a value for the end time
        a value for the priority
-Output: a new Photo Time object
This routine simply makes a new object and returns it
	return a new Photo Time object with the landmark, start time, end time, and priority


The photo time will have getters for the start time, end time, and priority


*Is Before*
*This is an implementation of a Greedy First Searchable routine
-Input: a photo time to compare to
-Output: a true false statement
This routine will return a true false statement to whether a given Photo Time
occurs before this Photo Time's start time
	return true if the new Photo Time's end time is before the beginning time of
	this Photo Time
	return false if the new Photo Time's end time is after the beginning time of this Photo Time

*Is After*
*This is an implementation of a Greedy First Searchable routine
-Input: a photo time to compare to
-Output: a true false statement
This routine will return a true false statement to whether a given Photo Time
occurs after this Photo Time's end time
	return true if the new Photo Time's end time is after the beginning time of 
	this Photo Time
	return false if the new Photo Time's end time is before the beginning time of this Photo Time

*Get Value*
*This is an implementation of a Greedy First Searchable routine
-Output: a digit value of the object
This routine gets the value of the Photo Time
	return the priority of the photo shoot

*Compare*
-Input: a photo time to compare to
-Output: a numerical representation of how the two photo times compare
This routine will be used to provide a way to sort the Photo Times
	if this Photo Time's end time is before the new Photo Time's end time
		we want to return 1
	if this Photo Time's end time is after the new Photo Time's end time
		we want to return -1
	if the end times are equal we want to defer to the priority
		The higher priority is more valuable than the lower priority

*To Sentece*
-Output: a list of characters that represent the object
This routine will be used to make a sentence describing the Photo Time
	return the name of the landmark
